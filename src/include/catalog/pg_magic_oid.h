/* ----------
 *		Object ID (OID) zero is InvalidOid.
 *
 *		OIDs 1-9999 are reserved for manual assignment (see .dat files in
 *		src/include/catalog/).  Of these, 8000-9999 are reserved for
 *		development purposes (such as in-progress patches and forks);
 *		they should not appear in released versions.
 *
 *		OIDs 10000-11999 are reserved for assignment by genbki.pl, for use
 *		when the .dat files in src/include/catalog/ do not specify an OID
 *		for a catalog entry that requires one.  Note that genbki.pl assigns
 *		these OIDs independently in each catalog, so they're not guaranteed
 *		to be globally unique.  Furthermore, the bootstrap backend and
 *		initdb's post-bootstrap processing can also assign OIDs in this range.
 *		The normal OID-generation logic takes care of any OID conflicts that
 *		might arise from that.
 *
 *		OIDs 12000-16383 are reserved for unpinned objects created by initdb's
 *		post-bootstrap processing.  initdb forces the OID generator up to
 *		12000 as soon as it's made the pinned objects it's responsible for.
 *
 *		OIDs beginning at 16384 are assigned from the OID generator
 *		during normal multiuser operation.  (We force the generator up to
 *		16384 as soon as we are in normal operation.)
 *
 * The choices of 8000, 10000 and 12000 are completely arbitrary, and can be
 * moved if we run low on OIDs in any category.  Changing the macros below,
 * and updating relevant documentation (see bki.sgml and RELEASE_CHANGES),
 * should be sufficient to do this.  Moving the 16384 boundary between
 * initdb-assigned OIDs and user-defined objects would be substantially
 * more painful, however, since some user-defined OIDs will appear in
 * on-disk data; such a change would probably break pg_upgrade.
 *
 * GPDB: we have some more built-in entries, so bumped FirstUnpinnedObjectId
 * (FirstBootstrapObjectId before PG15) from 12000 to 12500.  Thus the
 * genbki.pl / pinned range is 10000-12499 and the unpinned initdb range is
 * 12500-16383.
 *
 * NOTE: if the OID generator wraps around, we skip over OIDs 0-16383
 * and resume with 16384.  This minimizes the odds of OID conflict, by not
 * reassigning OIDs that might have been assigned during initdb.  Critically,
 * it also ensures that no user-created object will be considered pinned.
